<div style="text-align: justify">
Almost 2 years ago, on March 23, 2019, I organized Women Techmakers Salt Lake City's International Women's Day conference. It was a bittersweet moment for me. I was happy knowing that I was making history with this event. Sad because I knew this would be my last event in Salt Lake City. I was moving to San Francisco in the coming month, and I had to break it to the rest of the organizers that day, who became my family!

## Did things go wrong?
Of course, yes! The swag got delivered to the billing address instead of the shipping address. We also had a speaker cancellation before the event. Biggest of all, once I used non-inclusive promo materials for the event. #neverever

## Where did it all go right: 
### Speakers!!!

I got to hear from excellent speakers like [Sara Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saradansiejones/) (CEO of Inclusion Pro, Co-founder and COO of Women Tech Council), [Alicia Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicia-garcia-2150928/) (Executive VP People & Places at MasterControl), [Amanda Fisher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandajofisher/) (Product Manager at Beta Bionics), [Eshaani Esha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eshaaniishaa/) (Senior Salesforce Administrator - DevOps at Western Governors University), [Jenny Heiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyheiner/) (UX/UI Designer @ Divvy Inc), [Karen Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karenysun/) (CTO at Dwello), [Karen Vazques](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-vazquez-hernandez/) (Learning Experience Designer at WGU), [Michelle Kuo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellekuo/) (Managing Partner at JumpSearch Recruiting), [Miriah Peterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miriah-peterson-35649b5b/) (Data Engineer at Weave), [Oindrilla Sen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oindrilla-sen/) (Software Engineer II at Western Governors University), [Sarah Baughman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-baughman-8399b085/) (Full Stack Software Engineer at Openforce), [Tanei Atagi Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanei-atagi-henry-39546b133/) (Founder, Provo Girls Summit) and [Tejaswini Vaidya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tejaswinivaidya/) (Sr Director - Financial Services at InComm)! 

Their talks influenced me. We gave opportunity to many first time speakers and there was no way you could tell if they were first timers or a seasoned speaker. :)

Note: Since the time they spoke at IWD conference, some were promoted or changed jobs. Their job association mentioned here is the most recent, as per LinkedIn.

### Supportive Sponsors!!!

Without üí∞ this event would not have been possible. Big shoutout to the [Women Techmakers program @ Google](https://www.womentechmakers.com/), [Divvy](https://getdivvy.com/), [MasterControl](https://www.mastercontrol.com/), [Weave](https://www.getweave.com/), [Jane.com](https://jane.com/) for supporting the event financially. We were able to provide childcare facility, mothers room, many swags and giveaways.

### #IAmRemarkable Workshop and You!!!

![Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Badge](/media/iwd-2019-remarkable.jpg)

I was contemplating for a while regarding what to do in the workshop. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the session to prepare myself to become a facilitator, so whatever I knew about running this workshop was [via google search](https://iamremarkable.withgoogle.com/). Two days before the event, something very unpredictable happened, which made me realize I need to convert my weaknesses into strengths. And what better way than to scream out loud - **hell yeah! I AM REMARKABLE!** While I'll cover more about that in a TED talk, whenever that happens, I took the first step towards sharing my story. I had the **courage**! *Courage to take control of my life in my own hands.* Talking about my personal life in public was something I have never done before. And truth be told, I never imagined myself doing that ever. However, the willingness to move on from things that no longer serve any purpose in life was strong. In plain simple words, I FOUND ME in that workshop while facilitating. Someone confident. Someone happy in her life. It will be blatant a lie if I don't admit things have not been the same since then.

I took the opportunity to share my own story and hear from many attendees and their stories, which inspired me and motivated me. That comforted me. I found that I'm not alone. Considering the reviews and the feedback I received after the event, it looks like it changed their lives too. I also found many new friends whom I still cherish! üòá

You can find photos of the event [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/JBi8FgXJkXEHA15n7).

While I took a break in 2020 from the community and was not a part of IWD celebrations, I'm super super excited to welcome 2021 with 2 events! How to be a part of the celebration, you ask? 
- There's an [International Women's Day North America Summit](http://goo.gle/iwd-northamerica) on March 12-13, 2021. Register [here](http://goo.gle/iwd-northamerica). You'll get the opportunity to hear from a fantastic [lineup of speakers](https://events.withgoogle.com/international-womens-day-iwd-north-america-summit-2021/speakers/#content) and have the chance to win some awesome raffle prizes: Google Cloud Credits ($200 USD per voucher), Leadership Skills Workshop, Mentorship Sessions. *PS: You might see me in a cameo appearance.*ü§ì
- I'm also helping organize and speaking at Coast 2 Coast IWD Celebration on March 26, 2021. The workshop title is "Reframing Your Narrative" - where I'll help write a great LinkedIn bio! More details TBD.

(...and yes, they are both free to attend!)

I am super pumped to see you at both the events! Just like the event in 2019 changed my life, I hope this year's IWD event changes yours too! ‚ù§Ô∏è
