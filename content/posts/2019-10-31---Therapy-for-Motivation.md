# Am I ü•≥ today?
Not every day, I wake up with happy feelings..excited for the day (*I wish though!!!*) Some days, I go to bed again if I don't feel good after waking up üëÄ *For me, I come first. My mental health is always my üîù priority* I believe..if I'm taking care of myself, I can take care of everything else. For that, keeping myself motivated is a big task.

But.. I love over-thinking and over-analyzing situations. I have the power to think about the worst possible thing that could happen üòï Occasional meltdowns. Embarrassing moments. CRYing üòø In last 3 years, I've had many instances where I lost my cool. And you know what - _its okay_!

> "It's okay to cry. It helps clean your eyes and removes dirty water from your body." - my Dad üòÇ

**What's more important is how I get my life together after that.** ü•≥ I'm sharing some things that I do, to stay positive, to keep myself motivated, to stop myself from quitting. It's not easy every day. üôÇ It doesn't work every day. So what? It works some times, and that's what matters. I hope this will help you too! üòá

*Note: This is in no particular order. It works for me, might not work for you.*

## 1. Take proper rest üõå
Sleep. Sometimes when you don't feel right about something, take a damn nap. üí§ It helps. Then when you wake up, you'll be fresh and be able to start again with a new perspective. üòÄ

## 2. Believe in new üÜï beginnings
It's okay to start over and over again üîÅ. You don't have to wait until January 1 to start something new ü§ó Every day is a brand new, with new possibilities, with new opportunities. Start fresh every day ü§†

![Quote by Lalah Delia - New moon, New you.](/media/motivation-new-beginnings.jpg)

## 3. Talk to friends & family or your close ones ü§ù
Sometimes, just having someone you can talk to, someone who will listenüëÇ to you, helps a lot.  Whenever I get frustrated, I üìû my Dad and rants about everything. In that, he will provide me comfort and cheer me up. Text your friends. Talk to your mentor. Find a therapist üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
PS: I'll be happy to lend an ear whenever you need one. :)

## 4. Take ‚ë† day at a time üòå
Sometimes, things aren't easy, and you might feel like nothing is working; nothing is going right or as planned. When I was moving places in May, I was very much overwhelmed with everything going on in life. I knew San Francisco üåâ is where I want to be but made no plans. I panicked üò® when I got the job and realized I'd have to move in 2 weeks. Stepping outside comfort zone üòµ The best advice I got from my mentor was to take a deep breath üòå and take 1 day at a time.  Every day I woke up and planned for that exact day. That helped me for the next 3 months until I felt comfortable again üí´

## 5. Read inspirational books/quotes üìñ
I tried reading books like "The subtle art of not giving a fck," and "Everything is fked, but there's still hope."ü§û God knows, I only read 50ish pages of both the books before I stopped again. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I can't read books whatsoever. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But I read quotes in the morning every day until I find the one which makes me ready for the day. üòé

## 6. Surround yourself with people üëª who motivate you.
If you are on any social media, follow (don't ‚õîÔ∏è stalk/harass please) people who inspire you. I read stories on twitter about people doing fantastic ü§© in their fields, which excites üò≤ me to do good things. On Instagram, I've been following a few accounts who post inspirational quotes now and then. Every üåû I open Insta just to read good quotes to start my day. I'd highly recommend this.

![Quote by Gohar Abelian - Surround yourself with the game changers and magic makers.](/media/motivation-surrounding.jpg)

## 7. Find a hobby which makes you smile.
I sometimes bake desserts or go to üíÉüèª classes. Cooking disasters always brings a smile on my face. And if the baked item turns out good, then OHMYDESSERTS üéÇü•Æüç∞üßÅüç•! Dancing helps me forget everything going on in life, and be myself. If you are interested in üé®, üéô, üéπüé∏, üå≥, or any other activities - do it. Do whatever helps to get through the day.

## 8. Spend some quality me-time üòá
Stay quiet for a while. Take a üèù. I've realized that sometimes I need some me-time to recharge myself. Block off everything and DO NOTHING üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

![Quote by Beau Taplin: I have learned I can survive just about anything so long as I am occasionally allowed a few quiet moments to myself - time to restore my spirit, to mend my wounds, to regroup. A little me time and I can deal with anything the world sends my way.](/media/motivation-quality-time.jpg)

PS: No, not everytime you‚Äôve stay silent. Sometimes venting out anger/frustration, sobbing, screaming helps you calm down. Don‚Äôt be afraid to do it.

## 9. Take a break before/when burn-down happens.
Knowing when-to is not easy üòë Sometimes you might not realize it early, but as soon as you do, leave. It affects your mental health. Learn when to let things go. I give multiple chances to people, to situations - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Find the limit.

## 10. You don't have to share opinions on everything.
NO, seriously. You don't have to reply to every tweet. You ‚ùå have to say aloud whatever is on your mind. Please give it some ‚è∞ to resolve on its own. Last week, I over-analyzed a situation and created a problem in my head which never existed in the first place ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

![Quote from Moonbabe.se: My thoughts are optional. I can choose not to think them.](/media/motivation-fire.jpg)

## 11. SEEK WHATEVER SETS YOUR SOUL ON FIRE üî•
Wanna watch cute üê∂ and üò∏ videos? Please do it. Not in a mood to code üíª -> don't. Don't wanna wake up? Sleep again üò¥. Hungry? EAT.


# Final thoughts
**BE KIND TO YOURSELF! BE KIND TO OTHERS! BE YOU!** _Take pride in whatever you do. Honor you. Do it all for you. Appreciate yourself ‚òùüèª_
These are the things that help me. They might or might not work for you üôÇ I'm sharing this with the hope that at least one person will be inspired and feel good about themselves today or later, now or forever. As you start planning for 2020 goals, remember 2020 is very personal, and you owe yourself a lot.

_Please share in comments what works for you and what doesn't. I'm sure that will help me and everyone else. üòÉ_

Ending this post with some of my favorite quotes I recently read -

![Quote by Richelle E Goodrich - Don't ever give up. Don't ever give in. Don't ever stop trying. Don't ever sell out. And if you find yourself succumbing to one of the above for a brief moment, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, whisper a prayer, and start where you left off. But never, ever, ever give up.](/media/motivation-dont-give-up1.jpg)

![Quote by April Green - remember the time when you didn't think you could carry on; when the sky fell in on you, and the stars floated further away? And here you are. Still - wildflower turning towards the light. Never forget that there is endless grace in the place where you're standing. never forget that you belong here - exactly where you were designed to be.](/media/motivation-dont-give-up2.jpg)

![Quote by Yung pueblo on essentials for tough days: do not punish yourself. Give yourself ample kindness. Remember that all things change. Make sure that you get a good rest. Do things that will calm your mind. Accomplish smaller goals that day. Real acceptance can remove blocks. This is the time to practice patience. Growth can come with tough moments. a bad moment does not equal a bad life.](/media/motivation-dont-give-up3.jpg)
