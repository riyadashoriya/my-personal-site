Even after working full-time and juggling between deadlines, I missed studying. On June 15, 2017, I told my brother about how much I miss studying, and it looks like I'm not doing anything in my life. He suggested me to look for some certification courses.\n<p>After surfing on Google, I read about Oracle Certifications. On June 19, 2017, I went to the office and told my manager about my plan to give the OCAJP certification exam. She excitedly said it is great, and that I should go for this. I wanted to confirm the value of this certification, so after doing some rigorous research on the internet, I thought to give it a try.</p>\n<p>I got to know that people really prepare a lot for this exam. I thought I’ve Saturdays and Sundays to study. But honestly speaking, life sucks. I tried, but due to unforeseen circumstances every month (in 2017), I couldn’t focus much on the preparation.</p>\n<p>January 2018 passed fighting with depression. February started. Colleagues were talking about the long weekend break and that they are taking that week off.\nOn February 08, 2018, I decided that I’m going to do the same. Take two more days off, and give the exam on Thursday, Feb 22, 2018. I asked two of my friends (who are also OCAJP certified) about how they prepared. They suggested a preparation of at least two months is required to excel.</p>\n<p>That made me think if I’m doing the dumbest mistake of my life. People study for months, and I’m thinking that studying for just 5 days will help me get this certification! (Seriously, no kidding)</p>\n<p>After coming late to the home on February 16, 2018, the Friday, I thought I’ll start studying next day morning. I woke up on Saturday, glanced at the books and first thought: Oh fuck! This isn’t easy.</p>\n<p>But then, after blocking myself from the world for 5 days- 3 books, and few mock tests and listening to Wrong Direction (Passenger) on loop, I successfully cleared the exam :)</p>\n<p><strong><em>I am now an Oracle Certified Java SE 8 Associate Programmer!!!</em></strong> View my badge <a href=\"https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/3b44ec95-e4a8-41a0-97c0-04e7fef5c79e/linked_in_profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 352px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/ba1c3/ocajp-badge.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/8ac56/ocajp-badge.webp 240w,\n/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/edd59/ocajp-badge.webp 352w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/8ff5a/ocajp-badge.png 240w,\n/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/ba1c3/ocajp-badge.png 352w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/416e7684c70ec34c254dfd5ccf10a610/ba1c3/ocajp-badge.png\"\n            alt=\"Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Badge\"\n            title=\"Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer Badge\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Here is a list of the preparation material which I followed:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates (I’d highly recommend starting with this book)</li>\n<li>OCA Java SE8 Programmer Study Guide by Mala Gupta</li>\n<li>OCA Java SE8 Programmer Study Guide by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Mock tests:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>OCA Java SE8 Programmer Practice Tests by Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff</li>\n<li>Whizlabs mocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to thank my workplace and especially my manager Mary Jane for supporting me in doing this.
