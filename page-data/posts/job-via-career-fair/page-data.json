I only wish if someone had told me this. Ever since then, I’m sharing this with every student I’m meeting. I can proudly say the success rate is tremendous! Almost 90% of them have been able to land interviews. I feel so proud of them when they share their experiences. 🥳</p>\n<p><strong>Please please always do your research about the company before the career fair. This shows you know what you are looking for. You are very clear about your goals. This also helps cut the conversation short, and you to be able to focus on other things.👀</strong></p>\n<p>For students looking for sponsorship --- I know situation is not as favorable. You still need to ASK for it. At career fair, they’ll tell you that they don’t sponsor visas. But trust me, they’ll hire you and sponsor if they like your creds. <strong>Take that chance!</strong> 😇</p>\n<p><em>If you are looking for associate level positions, but you see only senior roles open on the website,</em> <strong>*APPLY**</strong>. If they like you, they will create a new position for you!! Says my personal experience!! 😎*</p>\n<p>Signing off with the hope that this will help you if you are looking for a job. Know of any student in a university? Please forward this article to them. 😀</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 260px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/ab8e0/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.58333333333333%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/8ac56/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.webp 240w,\n/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/079c7/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.webp 260w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/09b79/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.jpg 240w,\n/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/ab8e0/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.jpg 260w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/060cf9ded3cc2ccc78befe4fc7bc4c17/ab8e0/career-fair-everyone-gets-a-job.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Message screenshot of someone who texted me about how my tips helped with their job search\"\n            title=\"Message screenshot of someone who texted me about how my tips helped with their job search\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n</div>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/job-via-career-fair","tagSlugs":["/tag/career-fair/","/tag/jobseeker/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-11-10T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Getting a job via career fair is hard and no fun.
